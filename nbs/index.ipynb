    "The package name `dddex` stands for *Data-Driven Density Estimaton x*. New approaches are being implemented for estimating conditional densities without any parametric assumption about the underlying distribution. All those approaches take an arbitrary point forecaster as input and turn them into a new object that outputs an estimation of the conditional density based on the point predictions of the original point forecaster. The *x* in the name emphasizes that the approaches can be applied to any point forecaster. The approaches are being implemented via the two classes `LevelSetKDEx` and `LevelSetKDEx_kNN` whose usage is explained in detail below.\n",

    "To ensure compatibility with Scikit-Learn, as usual the classes `LevelSetKDEx` and `LevelSetKDEx_kNN` both implement a `fit` and `predict` method. As the purposes of both classes is to compute estimations of conditional densities, the `predict` method outputs p-quantiles rather than point forecasts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our choice of the class-names is supposed to be indicative of the underlying models:  The name *LevelSet* stems from the fact that both methods operate with the underlying assumption that the values of point forecasts generated by the same point forecaster can be interpreted as a similarity measure between samples. *KDE* is short for *Kernel Density Estimator* and the *x* yet again signals that the classes can be initialized with any point forecasting model. \n",

As explained above, `LevelSetKDEx` is always based on a point forecaster that is being specified by the user.
