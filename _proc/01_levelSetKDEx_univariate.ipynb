    "In the following we define the classes [`LevelSetKDEx`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex_univariate.html#levelsetkdex) and [`LevelSetKDEx_kNN`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex_univariate.html#levelsetkdex_knn) where KDE is short for 'Kernel Density Estimator' and the 'x' is supposed to signal that both classes can be defined based on any arbitrary point predictor. The name 'LevelSet' stems from the fact that every approach presented in this notebook interprets the values of the point forecasts as a similarity measure between samples. The point predictor is specified by the argument `estimator` and must have a `.predict()`-method and should have been trained before hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both classes [`LevelSetKDEx`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex_univariate.html#levelsetkdex) and [`LevelSetKDEx_kNN`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex_univariate.html#levelsetkdex_knn) fulfill the same task: By first running `.fit(XTrain, yTrain)` and then calling `.generateWeights(XTest)`, they both output an estimation of the conditional density of every sample specified by 'XTest'. The basic idea for both approaches is also identical: Suppose we have a single test sample at hand. At first, we compare the value of the point prediction of this sample and the values of the point predictions of the training samples computed via `estimator.predict(XTrain)` and `estimator.predict(XTest)`, respectively. Based on this comparison, we select 'binSize'-many training samples that we deem the most similar to the test sample at hand. The concrete way we select the training samples constitutes the only difference between [`LevelSetKDEx`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex_univariate.html#levelsetkdex) and [`LevelSetKDEx_kNN`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex_univariate.html#levelsetkdex_knn). Finally, the empirical distribution of the y-values of these training samples then acts as our estimation of the conditional distribution.\n",
