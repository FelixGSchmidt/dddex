## How to use: LevelSetKDEx

The approaches
[`LevelSetKDEx`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex.html#levelsetkdex)
and
[`LevelSetKDEx_kNN`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex.html#levelsetkdex_knn)
are designed to convert any point predictor into an estimator of the
conditional density of the underlying data. Further details can be found
in the notebook `levelSetKDEx.ipynb`.

``` python
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor
from dddex.levelSetKDEx import LevelSetKDEx
```
