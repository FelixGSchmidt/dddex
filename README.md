## What is dddex?

The package name `dddex` stands for *Data-Driven Density Estimaton x*.
New approaches are being implemented for estimating conditional
densities without any parametric assumption about the underlying
distribution. All those approaches take an arbitrary point forecaster as
input and turn them into a new object that outputs an estimation of the
conditional density based on the point predictions of the original point
forecaster. The *x* in the name emphasizes that the approaches can be
applied to any point forecaster. The approaches are being implemented
via the two classes
[`LevelSetKDEx`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex.html#levelsetkdex)
and
[`LevelSetKDEx_kNN`](https://kaiguender.github.io/dddex/levelsetkdex.html#levelsetkdex_knn)
whose usage is explained in detail below.

All models can be run easily with only a few lines of code and are
designed to be compatible with the well known *Scikit-Learn* framework.
